rabin2 -z impossible_password.bin
shows you the strings
first password is SuperSeKretKey

./impossible_password.bin 
to run the file
enter the first password but it asks for a second

lets try
ltrace ./impossible_password.bin
typing root in the second password gives us the second password, but its not static 

we have no choice but to look at what the program is doing at a low level.
radare2 -AA impossible_password.bin 
v to see visual mode p to change modes
VV for graphical mode

We find three interesting calls.
0x004007b3
0x004007d9
0x00400802

0x00400968 750c jne 0x400976
should be changed to 
0x00400968 740c je 0x400976

@need to update what above does 

Now to solve
radare2 -AA -w impossible_password.bin  #Open and analysize in write mode
s 0x00400968  #go to cell 
pd 6  @show the number of lines below the cell
wa je 0x400976 @0x00400968  #modify the condition
Written 2 byte(s) (je 0x400976) = wx 740c  #result

exit
./impossible_password.bin #run file
enter SuperSeKretKey and root as passwords
flag is got.
